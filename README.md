
## A Story of Passionate Software Engineer
You have an idea develop a website which allow users to store and share GPS track online (similar to http://www.trackprofiler.com/track/index).
You are the only one who is going to be in charge of the backend service development.

1 WS API with three endpoints:

- An endpoint that allow users to upload "gpx" file and store mandatory information such as "metadata, waypoint, track" 
- An endpoint to return a list of "Latest track" from our users
- An endpoint to allow users to view details of their gpx file

You are a professional software engineer. You don't allow yourself to code without a System Diagram or Workflow Diagram, or produce "dirty-code" and code without Unit Tests.
